# MySQL/MySQLi Wrapper for PHP
a wrapper written in PHP designed to:

* more easily maintain MySQL database interaction [i.e. - bug fixes, passwords, etc.]
* can efficiently switch between MySQL and MySQLi (no code outside the class needs to be changed)
* makes runtime queries much more simple and organized.
